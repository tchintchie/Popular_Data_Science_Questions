# Popular Data Science Questions

In this scenario, you're working for a company that creates data science content, be it books, online articles, videos or interactive text-based platforms like Dataquest.

You're tasked with figuring out what is best content to write about. Because you took this course, you know that given the lack of instructions there's some leeway in what "best" means here.

Since you're passionate about helping people learn, you decide to scower the internet in search for the answer to the question "What is it that people want to learn about in data science?" (as opposed to determining the most profitable content, for instance).

Thinking back to your experience when you first started learning programming, it occurs to you that if you wanted to figure out what programming content to write, you could consult Stack Overflow (a question and answer website about programming) and see what kind of content is more popular.

The fact that DSSE https://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#percentanswered https://datascience.stackexchange.com is a data science dedicated site (contrarily to the others), coupled with it having a lot of an unanswered questions, makes it an ideal candidate for this investigation. DSSE will be the focus of this guided project.
